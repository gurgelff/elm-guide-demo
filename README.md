## My implementations of the official Elm's Guide examples

# How to
- After installing Elm, open the terminal/cmd, run cd elm-guide-demo  and **run "elm reactor".** Open a browser, in the address bar type: localhost:8000
- In the Browser, use the app to go to SRC dir and click on any elm file to view the corresponding webapp running.
* Other way is just type in terminal/cmd **elm make FILENAME.elm**, and open the resulting file (index.html).
